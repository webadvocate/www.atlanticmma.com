  <h3>UFC 94 Preview: Thiago Silva and Lyoto Machida Interviews</h3>

  <div class="article-meta">
    <p>Posted in <a href="../../../mma-blog.html">MMA Blog</a></p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-body">
    <p><strong>Thiago Silva</strong></p>


	<p><strong>How is the training for the fight?</strong><br />The training is the usual, very strong, with much sparring, blocking, fitness preparation&#8230; I’m making full preparation, training it all. I’m a guy who is always trying to complete, I don’t do specific training. My thing is to drop inside, I always try to finish fights, either standing or on the floor, this specialization thing is not for me.</p>


	<p><strong>How do you expect the fight to go?</strong><br />I look at the facts. Lyoto is a guy that has the same record that I do, 13 fights, but I think he has eight victories by decision. He doesn’t fall for the combat and, if he does, I’ll thank God. I believe he will run away the entire fight and I&#8217;m prepared for this. My head is good and he won&#8217;t get me nervous. If he runs, I’ll run after him.</p>


	<p><strong>Lyoto is pointed as one of the toughest fighters of the weight class. What will your situation be in the <span class="caps">UFC</span> with a victory over him?</strong><br />It’s two unbeaten, we’re in the same goal of winning the belt. I’m doing my work, I prefer to wait for the end of the fight. It is very cool, having the chance to fight with the best in the world is very gratifying. I’m humble, I&#8217;m not assuming anything and I’m here to do my job. I have dreams to come true and I&#8217;m in the race.</p>


	<p><strong>What did you think about the victory of Quinton Jackson over Wanderlei Silva at <span class="caps">UFC 92</span>?</strong><br />It surprised me a lot. I found Rampage very concentrated, Wanderlei as always in the aggressive style, I admire him a lot, I reflected very much on him in the beginning, loved him, but in this fight I thought Rampage came more concentrated, more closed and ended up getting to the knockout.</p>


	<p><strong>Many people believe that Wanderlei focused a lot on fitness preparation and less on training sparring, which he had been doing in Xtreme Couture. Do you think this counted in the fight?</strong><br />I think the name &#8220;MMA&#8221; says it all, everything has to merge. I don’t know what his drills are, I haven’t followed, but today there are many athletes who focus more on preparation than on the rest and I don’t think this is good because, wanting or not, the technique will prevail in the end. Conditioning is important, but in my opinion, technique is above.</p>


	<p><strong>In an interview to <span class="caps">TATAME</span>, you had bet on the victory of Rashad Evans on Forrest Griffin&#8230; What did you think of the fight?</strong><br />I thought it was cool. Forrest printed a good game on top, but ended up crashing on the floor. Rashad was much more prepared at the ground and knew how to advantage. I thought it was cool, an unbeaten owner of a belt and, God willing, we will have two unbeaten disputing the belt&#8230; It will be cool, huh?</p>


	<p><strong>How do you think a fight would be with you against Rashad?</strong><br />It would be a very tough fight. He has a very good wrestling and improved considerably on his feet. I would love to do this fight, honestly.</p>


	<p><strong>Looking past Lyoto, who do you believe that the <span class="caps">UFC</span> will put in front of you? Do you think you can face another Brazilian, Wanderlei or Luiz &#8220;Banha&#8221; Cane?</strong><br />I’m a professional, I want to win. Wanderlei is with a defeat and I heard rumors that he’ll go down in weight and Cane is okay, but I think he has to walk a lot, he just entered in the <span class="caps">UFC</span>. He has skills, but I need to value me. I’m here for a while and I want to fight with who is winning and who is with the belt.</p>


	<p><strong>And the victory of Jorge Santiago and Antônio “Pezão” (Big Foot) in Japan? How is the climate in <span class="caps">ATT</span>?</strong><br />The team is more united, training is very good. Yesterday we had over 70 people training <span class="caps">MMA</span> in the <span class="caps">ATT</span>, one helps the other&#8230; Here is my home and I’m very happy. It’s very cool, you have to see to believe.</p>


	<p><strong>Lyoto Machida</strong></p>


	<p><strong>How is the preparation for the fight against Thiago Silva?</strong><br />I&#8217;ve been training for this fight for a long time, I’m in the 16th week of training, so now I&#8217;m already in the final straight of the training, making the replenishment of energy, technical part&#8230; I’m with my father and my brother, and my fitness coach, who are helping me a lot here in straight final. I’m making a strategy for the fight too&#8230;</p>


	<p><strong>Have you already started to worry about the issue of weight?</strong><br />I weigh 213 pounds, which is my normal weight and, when it gets to the time of the fight, I’ll go to the United States with about 209 pounds, and lose the rest to the fight and then recover it. I&#8217;m familiar with it, I train in this weight and have lost it before.</p>


	<p><strong>What are you training specifically for him?</strong><br />I&#8217;m training my specialty first, the stand up game, my Karate, I’ve been focusing in this a lot, also the takedown part and the ground game. I do the complete training, but I prioritize what I have better, my strongest weapon, stand up fight. We always study the opponent, I do this for about three months, seeing how he is, where he works, so I can beat up on these things not being surprised.</p>


	<p><strong>Recently, Dana White gave an interview and said you have everything to be the best fighter pound for pound, in the future. What do you think of that?</strong><br />I’m very honored to receive this compliment from Dana White, who isn’t just an owner or promoter of an event, he understands the fight and more or less where each fighter wants to get, where mistakes are being made, what&#8217;s missing, and I’ll strive to reach his expectations and my fans. I think anyone would be honored and happy to receive this compliment, but I’ll work with humility to be better and not be thinking that I’m the best. I don’t think anything like that. Everyone has their stage, I&#8217;m getting better in every fight, training a lot, gaining confidence and I think this is important for my career.</p>


	<p><strong>If you beat Thiago, do you believe that will win the chance for the belt?</strong><br />I think that if I don’t recieve the title shot, I’ll be very close. The weight class is getting harder every day, the fighters are strong, then I believe that if I won’t be a candidate for the belt&#8230; I’ll train more and I think it will even be good, because I’ll get more fights and get there more well-rounded&#8230; I think I deserve a chance to dispute the belt, but it’s a decision of the <span class="caps">UFC</span> and I’m calm about that. My time will come.</p>


	<p><strong>What did you think of the fight between Wanderlei Silva and Quinton Jackson?</strong><br />In every fight, anything can happen. I thought Wanderlei was the favorite, even because he had already beaten him twice, but every day <span class="caps">MMA</span> grows in popularity and technically. Comparing, six years ago everything was very different, today is more strategic, if you make a little mistake you can lose the fight. The Americans are getting better, everybody wants their place in the sun, so what happened was this. Quinton got a strategy that fitted better that day, but I’m not saying he is better. As the Minotauro&#8230; That day Frank Mir was better, but Minotauro is able to turn things around, is young and tomorrow can be better than them and that&#8217;s my vision. <span class="caps">MMA</span> is growing so much that one loses today, the other wins tomorrow, everyone is studying and you cannot make mistakes.</p>


	<p><strong>After the fight, Dana White spoke about the possibility of &#8220;Rampage&#8221; fighting for the belt. Do you agree with that?</strong><br />I really thought it would happen, Quinton is very popular, is an ex-champion, and every guy that already had the belt has bigger luggage, such as Wanderlei, if he had passed Quinton, I recognize that he could go to the belt directly. I&#8217;m still growing, building my way, and after I become the champion, all right, I’ll be at another level than they already are. Perhaps for what he has already done and because of his popularity, he really deserved, but I&#8217;m training, living day to day, doing what I like&#8230; I believe my time will come. I&#8217;m not worried whether it will be today or tomorrow, just know that I’ll have a chance to get this belt.</p>


	<p><strong>Were you predicting a victory of Rashad Evans over Forrest Griffin?</strong><br />I thought that Forrest would win, but, as always, every fight has two sides and Rashad is a tough guy, created a good strategy, know the right time and, every guy like that becomes dangerous, calls you to his game&#8230; It was what he did, waited, waited and was even worse in the fight, but the chance appeared and he didn’t lose it, ended the fight. I think Forrest has more resistance, even more technical on foot, but Rashad is a strategist and this counts a lot today.</p>


	<p><strong>What is the way to beat him?</strong><br />Look, I think Rashad is a complete guy, has the wrestling as a background, but I see some flaws in his game, although I’m not worried with him now. My focus is Thiago. I look, but I don’t get much information of the opponents that I’m not focused, but I see some holes in his game (Rashad), but I prefer not to think yet, he is not the one for now.</p>
