  <h3>Q&amp;A: TUF 8's Phillipe Nover</h3>

  <div class="article-meta">
    <p>Posted in <a href="/mma-blog.html">MMA Blog</a></p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-body">
    <p>Philippe Nover is an up-and-coming Filipino-American fighter who Dana White has called, “the next Anderson Silva”.  Nover holds a brown belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu under Alexander &#8220;Soca&#8221; Freitas and fights out of Team Insight.  He&#8217;s been fighting professionally since 2003.  He joined Atlantic <span class="caps">MMA</span> contributor Jeff Lacap for a one-on-one conversation about life in the Ultimate Fighter house, balancing a nursing and an <span class="caps">MMA</span> career and the possibility of fighting in the Philippines.</p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong>  How did you get started in mixed martial arts?</p>


	<p><strong>Phillipe:</strong>  <em>When I was younger, I was always involved in martial arts.  My parents enrolled me in more traditional martial arts like Jeet Kune Do, Muay Thai, Filipino Arnis and others.  Before I started <span class="caps">MMA</span>, I did a lot of sparring tournaments.  Then I started watching the <span class="caps">UFC</span>.  At first, I couldn’t picture myself doing that.  But after my first amateur Muay Thai fight, I started feeling real confident.  Then my sparring partner had his first <span class="caps">MMA</span> match and he thought I would do well in <span class="caps">MMA</span>, so I tried it out.  After 2003, I was hooked.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong>  You balance a full-time registered nurse work load and training for <span class="caps">MMA</span>.  What’s that schedule like?</p>


	<p><strong>Phillipe:</strong>  <em>When I was fighting smaller shows, I was working three 12-hour shifts a week.  I would do an extra 8 to 10 hour part-time tour and I would train for upcoming fights.   I would be doing night tours and I would come in 7:30 at night and leave at 8:00 in the morning.  At 3:00 a.m. on my break I would go to the doctor’s lounge and run on the treadmill, or go outside for a run or run the stairs in the hospital.  When I was done, I’d take a 15-minute shower and go back to work.  I would be stuffing protein bars in as my dinner.  Everyone slept on their break, I was running.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong>  On this season of The Ultimate Fighter, the house has been pretty crazy.  How did you keep your sanity?</p>


	<p><strong>Phillipe:</strong>  <em>The house was definitely crazy.  They didn’t exaggerate it at all.  I didn’t go away for college but my friends say it was like a frat house.  You have a whole bunch of guys in their twenties and you had that whole attitude through the whole house.  But I kept my focus.  I never really got too involved in the craziness.  Other than the fruit incident, I didn’t really get involved.  And the first incident with Junie, I wasn’t there for that.  Those guys were up till 2:00 a.m., I went to bed at 10:00.  It was nuts.  Most of the guys who already got eliminated, they went on a rampage.  While the fighters who were still in it, tried to stay focused.  You have to separate that mentally and just step away from that.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong>  On the first episode of this season’s The Ultimate Fighter, you fainted.  Do you think Dana and the other fighters underestimated you?</p>


	<p><strong>Phillipe:</strong>  <em>Dana initially underestimated me.  First of all, Joe Duarte had a stacked resume.  He had something like over 30 fights, mostly non <span class="caps">MMA</span>, but boxing and kickboxing.  He was a really tough dude and he sold himself well.  He told everyone how bad he was and other guys confirmed it.  Here I am fighting this big bad ass and I’m this weak, registered nurse.  I played that role from day one.  There was no way I could change people’s mind other than showing them in the cage.  So I just stayed quiet.  The whole time he (Duarte) looked at me before the fight, I pretended to not be able to look back at him.  I pretended to have this weak mentality.  But as soon as the bell rang, that’s when I turned it on.  I knew he wasn’t going to want to be in the cage with me.  Dana called me “Fainting Felipe” and I really wanted to prove something after that.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong>  On the show, Nogueira comes off as a real genuine guy who cares about his fighters.  Can you talk about his influence on you?</p>


	<p><strong>Phillipe:</strong>  <em>Nogueira is a great guy and a great coach.  Not to take anything away from Mir.  I know that the show makes Mir look like not such a great guy.  But I enjoyed both coaches.  I think ‘Big Nog’ is an incredible fighter.  Every night before a fight, he would come by the house and talk to the fighters and prep us and get us ready for the fight.  His presence there was such an inspiration.  I look up to him and when he fights Mir, I really hope he takes it to him.</em></p>


	<p><em>You know, as nice as he is, he’s just as tough mined, a great competitor.  During the soccer match episode, he wanted to win so badly.  He had all the soccer gear on and he was sweating like crazy.  He was such a hard worker and I really admire that about him.</em></p>


	<p><em>Most days we would train twice a day.  He was always there early and he training boxing with Stankie before our practice.</em></p>


	<p><em>I remember one time he said that he was feeling sick and might not come train that night.  But he came anyway and he trained with us.  Nogueira took advantage of situation and he wasn’t just going to party it up in Vegas.  He was focused.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong>  Other than Nogueira, who do you look up to in <span class="caps">MMA</span>?</p>


	<p><strong>Phillipe:</strong>  <em>I look up to Anderson Silva and <span class="caps">GSP</span>.  They are the new age fighters.  They have incredible groundwork, incredible take downs, they are completely well-rounded fighters.  It doesn’t matter who they fight, they have the ability to win.  I look up to both of them.</em></p>


	<p><em>But I&#8217;m not on that level yet.  I still have a far ways to go as a fighter.  I still look at myself as a little fish but I least I got myself into the water.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong>  The <span class="caps">UFC</span> has expressed interest in putting on a show in the Philippines.  Have they contacted you about being in that show?</p>


	<p><strong>Phillipe:</strong>  <em>I have heard the <span class="caps">UFC</span> is going to the Philippines.  It would be so much of an honor to be on that card.  I know I would represent the Philippines and make all Filipinos proud if I get on that show.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong>  Do you have any plans on doing any training, seminars or opening an <span class="caps">MMA</span> school in the Philippines?</p>


	<p><strong>Phillipe:</strong>  <em>I remember when I went back a year and a half ago.  I trained at Alvin Aguilar’s satellite school.  I love training with the guys over there. I think in the future I would love to train or open a school.</em></p>


	<p><em>But when I do something, I have to do it 100%.  Right now I’m not in the teaching mode.  I’m really focused on fighting right now.  But in the future I would love to do something in the Philippines.  I know there are so many good fighters in the Philippines that would make a big impact on <span class="caps">MMA</span>.  We just have it in our blood, that warrior’s blood.</em></p>


	<p><em>Hopefully they’ll have some local Filipino fighters on that card because they have some really good fighters.  It would be a great opportunity to teach over there.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong>  Since we&#8217;re talking about Filipino fighters, do you have a prediction for the Pacquiao/De La Hoya fight?</p>


	<p><strong>Phillipe:</strong>  <em>I have to go with my man Pacquiao.  I’ll go with Manny by decision.  I know Oscar is bigger and it might be harder for Pacquiao to land his power shots but Pacquiao is faster.  I think he can take the victory.  I know the whole Philippines will be watching and I can’t wait for that fight.  I hear in the Philippines that when Manny fights, there isn’t a single person on the street.  So I’ll be rooting for Manny.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong>  What are your future plans?  Do you think you’ll continue with nursing or devote all your time to <span class="caps">MMA</span>?</p>


	<p><strong>Phillipe:</strong>  <em>I’m going to be 99% fighter and 1% nurse.  I’m not going to give up nursing completely.  I’m actually still going to school once a week to pursue a higher level of nursing.  It’s a great balance.  I don’t want to be so focused on the fighting and forget about what I’ve been doing for the last 4 to 5 years of my life in nursing, the healing part of my life.  When you help someone, it gives you that balance.  You don’t want to spend all day thinking about knocking someone out or breaking their arm, I’d go crazy.  With nursing, I can go to work and put someone&#8217;s arms back together.  There’s a real balance for me.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong>  Is there anything else you’d like to add?</p>


	<p><strong>Phillipe:</strong>  <em>I’d like to thank my parents and my team, Team Insight.</em></p>


	<p><em>They’re the reason I’m where I’m at right now.  It’s a combination of my resiliency, my training and their support for me.  They are the ones who are there for me during my ups and downs.</em></p>


	<p><em>Team Insight is like my family.  We rely on each other for so much.  It’s not a business relationship or a team relationship, it’s a real family.</em></p>
