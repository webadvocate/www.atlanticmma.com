  <h3>UFC on Fox 4 Breakdown</h3>

  <div class="article-meta">
    <p>Posted in <a href="/mma-blog.html">MMA Blog</a></p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-body">
    <p>This Saturday night the <span class="caps">UFC</span> returns to Fox for the fourth time. I don&#8217;t know about you but as a long time <span class="caps">MMA</span> fan I love it every time we get free <span class="caps">MMA</span> on a mainstream network! Oh how far we have come.</p>


	<p>Not only that but Saturdays fights features 4 of the top Light Heavyweights vying for a shot at the title. Originally Dana White indicated the winner of the Rua vs Vera main event would be awarded a title shot but fan and media backlash at the thought of Vera, who is currently 1-2-1 in his last 4, getting a title shot caused White to recant and change the opportunity to the most impressive winner out of the main and co-main fights.<br /><br></p>


	<h4>UFC on <span class="caps">FOX 4 </span>Co-Main Event Ryan Bader vs Lyoto Machida<br /><br></h4>


	<p>The Co-Main Event features Ryan Bader vs Lyoto &#8220;The Dragon&#8221; Machida. This will be Baders second former champion opponent in a row as he makes his way back into title contention. After a marquee win over Antonio Rogerio Nogueira he then lost two in a row, one to Jon Jones and then a somewhat shocking loss to Tito Ortiz. He then dominated Jason Brilz with a first round KO before taking to Japan and defeated Quinton &#8220;Rampage&#8221; Jackson.</p>


	<p>Bader has maintained his very “American” fighting style of strong wrestling and boxing skills. While having always been an elite wrestler, the natural power in his hands has caused him to develope his boxing considerably since his debut on The Ultimate Fighter.</p>


	<p>One critique on Bader could be his angles and footwork or lack thereof. He tends to come forward exclusively and while that movement can be predictable, his ability to switch from punches to takedowns quickly compensates in keeping opponents on their toes and this skill will be key in his fight this Saturday.</p>


	<p>In the other corner, the once undefeated Lyoto Machida is now 1-3 in his last 4 fights which started in May of 2009 when he lost the Light Heavyweight Championship to Mauricio “Shogun” Rua in their title rematch. His other losses were by decision to Rampage Jackson and Submission to current champ Jon Jones with a KO win over the retired Randy Couture sandwiched between.</p>


	<p>While once considered an elusive puzzle of angles and movement, Machida looked controllable in his 2 bouts with Rua and loss against Jackson. Jackson in particular was able to cut off the ring and limit Machidas range while being able to land his own shots.</p>


	<p>Jones of course made him look very beatable but so far Jones has done that to every top 5 fighter in his division.</p>


	<p>The key for Machida is to get back to the angles and movement that made him hard to hit but also allowed him to move in and out to deliver his own strikes. One thing we might see changed in Machida is his wrestling now that he is spending most of his time in the US as opposed to Brazil. He has always had excellent trips and throws but more exposure to American style wrestling will definitely be an important factor in his fight against Ryan Bader.</p>


	<p>The keys to this fight are for Bader to be able to restrict Machidas movement enough to land his punches and takedowns while Machida will need to stay out of range and move in to deliver his strikes but get back out before Bader can counter with a takedown.</p>


	<p>In my opinion this fight is closer than the oddsmakers think but I expect Machidas movement to be unpredictable enough to give Bader problems finding his range and allow Machida to accumulate strikes on his way to a late knockout. With odds heavily favoring Machida at -335 though, those with the propensity to &#8220;invest&#8221; in their <span class="caps">MMA</span> viewing may want to pass on this one as even a half unit on Bader at +255 isn&#8217;t enticing.<br /><br></p>


	<h4>UFC on <span class="caps">FOX 4 </span>Main Event Mauricio &#8220;Shogun&#8221; Rua vs Brandon Vera<br /><br></h4>


	<p>The Main Event of the evening, as Bruce Buffer would say pits former champion Mauricio &#8220;Shogun&#8221; Rua vs Brandon &#8220;The Truth&#8221; Vera. This seems like an easy fight for Rua and does not do much to help his image after reports that he turned down a fight against the dangerous Glover Teixeira due to Teixeira&#8217;s lack of name value.</p>


	<p>Also the fact that Vera could be up for a title shot was a shock to most of the <span class="caps">MMA</span> community as he has only been in the win column once in the past 3 years. The fight will go on however with a potential title shot on the line.</p>


	<p>Rua had won the Light Heavy Weight title via KO from Lyoto Machida in 2010 before losing it to reigning champ Jon Jones. Rua then rebounded with a revenge knockout of Forrest Griffin and most recently lost one of the most exciting fights ever to the returning Dan Henderson who faces off against Jones for the title in September.</p>


	<p>Either standing or on the ground, Rua is a threat to finish. His blend of powerful Muay Thai and dynamic Brazilian Jiu Jitsu game as well as good trip takedowns keeps opponents guessing and gives him many tools to finish any opponent. While Rua coming in injured or out of shape is always a lingering possibility, he is basically the better version of Vera.</p>


	<p>Vera has had more downs than ups and while coming off a decision win against Elliot Marshall in October of 2011 was 0-2-1 in his previous 3 fights. As I mentioned many fans and media had expressed confusion as to how Vera could be in a title conversation and after a social media outcry; Dana White announced that should the winner of Machida vs Bader be more impressive then one of those could earn the shot as well. It seems likely that the initial shot was mostly meant for Rua which is a rematch that makes sense should Jones get past Henderson and Vera is simply in the right place at the right time to try and get the most out of this situation.</p>


	<p>Vera is very similar to Shogun as he relies heavily on his Muay Thai skills that served him well in his earlier Heavyweight run. He&#8217;s also shown decent submission skills against lesser opponents in the past but has not been able to perform against higher tier fighters.</p>


	<p>While it may seem that I&#8217;ve been down on Vera, fighters improve between fights so anything is possible. That being said, barring any injuries, I expect Rua to come out and outstrike Vera on his way to a first or second round KO. Rua comes in at a -365 which is right where the line should be. Given the amount of investment and small return, I&#8217;ll be passing on this one as well.<br /><br></p>


	<h4>UFC on <span class="caps">FOX 4 </span>Undercard Fights<br /><br></h4>


	<h4>Mike Swick vs DeMarques Johnson<br /><br></h4>


	<p>Other fights of note on the <span class="caps">UFC</span> on Fox 4 card is the return of Mike &#8220;Quick&#8221; Swick against DeMarques Johnson. Swick has been plagued by injuries for the past two and a half years but was always an exciting fighter to watch.</p>


	<p>After a 4 fight win streak he dropped two in a row to Dan Hardy and Paulo Thiago. Swick now to looks to come back not only from the losses, but substantial time out of the cage and the dreaded &#8220;ring rust&#8221; a fighter experiences in his comfort and timing.</p>


	<p>Johnson has been trading wins and losses against mid level fighters for the past two years and while some have said this is a &#8220;gimme&#8221; comeback fight for Swick, Johnson has the tools to spoil the party should Swick be off his game.</p>


	<p>That being said, I&#8217;ll look for Swick to come in excited and guns blazing and score a quick knockout to mark his return to the welterweight division.</p>


	<h4>Joe Lauzon vs Jamie Varner<br /><br></h4>


	<p>Another fight that I believe will be the most exciting on the card is the resurgent former <span class="caps">WEC</span> champion Jamie Varner vs Joe Lauzon.</p>


	<p>After two years on the local circuit, Varner took advantage of a late replacement opportunity when Evan Dunham was injured. Varner came in against Edson Barboza. Barboza was coming off his highlight real knock out of Terry Etim (via spinning wheel kick mind you) and was a heavy favorite.</p>


	<p>Varner came in strong and knocked out the then undefeated Barboza in the first round. Lauzon was coming off his own underdog win over Melvin Guillard before falling to the head kick of Anthony Pettis.</p>


	<p>Lauzon tends to dominate lower tier fighters and has only come up short 4 times in the <span class="caps">UFC</span> to top level fighters so this will be a tough test to where Varner really is at this point in his career.</p>


	<p>Varner has been susceptible to submissions in the past and that is Lauzons bread and butter. Varner should have an advantage in the wrestling department however and while both have power in their hands, Varners ability to dictate where the fight takes place and potentially steal rounds with late takedowns should serve him well.</p>


	<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of both fighters so this pains me but I&#8217;m looking for Varner to switch up between powerful straight punches and takedowns to keep Lauzon guessing with Varner either winning a decision or third round <span class="caps">TKO</span>.</p>


	<p>Coming in &#8220;Even&#8221; I think Varner also represents good value for a small unit/unit and a half wager should you be so inclined.<br /><br></p>
