  <h3>Q&amp;A: TUF Finalist Ryan Bader</h3>

  <div class="article-meta">
    <p>Posted in <a href="/mma-blog.html">MMA Blog</a></p>
  </div>

  <div class="article-body">
    <p>Ryan “Darth&#8221; Bader is a world-class amateur wrestler turned mixed martial artist who is also one of the light heavyweight finalists on this season&#8217;s The Ultimate Fighter: Team Nogueira vs. Team Mir.  He is a three-time All-Pac 10 and a two-time All-American wrestler at Arizona State University.  Bader currently trains at Arizona Combat Sports alongside <span class="caps">TUF</span> alum C.B. Dolloway, <span class="caps">WEC </span>Lightweight Champion Jamie Varner and <span class="caps">UFC </span>Middleweight Thales Leites.  He joined AtlanticMMA contributor Jeff Lacap and discussed his life before the reality show, his <span class="caps">TUF </span>Finals opponent and Arizona Combat Sports</p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> You have an impressive amateur wrestling background being named three-time Pac-10 champion and two-time All American at Arizona State.  How did you get introduced to mixed martial arts?</p>


	<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> <em>I was introduced into <span class="caps">MMA</span> basically through wrestling. I was a big fan of it while I was pursuing my amateur wrestling career. After I had graduated Jesse Forbes was fighting Matt Hamill on the <span class="caps">TUF </span>Finale and needed some help with his wrestling. CB and I helped him out with his wrestling and also were doing some Jiu Jitsu with him. From there Jesse invited us into Arizona Combat Sports and we never left.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> If you weren’t doing <span class="caps">MMA</span>, what career would you have pursued?</p>


	<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> <em>I honestly couldn&#8217;t tell you. I was working in sales and marketing after I graduated and before I left to train full time. But that job was something that I knew I wouldn’t want to do with the rest of my life. I had thought about going to law school after <span class="caps">ASU</span> to concentrate on contracts and go into sports management.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Talk about your appearance on <span class="caps">TUF</span>.  What are some of the lessons you will take with you from that experience?  Any regrets?</p>


	<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> <em>It was a great experience. I made some great friends, and great contacts. I also learned from the best in the game with Nogueira and his staff. I have continued my relationship with Nogueira and most of the guys from the show. He says I’m always welcome to train with them and visa versa. The show also forced me to completely focus on my goal, and that was to get through the nonsense of the house and win my fights to make it to the finale. I don’t really regret anything.  Maybe not eating urine-soaked fruit would be one!</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> How’s training going for the Finals?   Are you changing your routine?</p>


	<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> <em>Training is going great, I have my usually training partners plus a couple more studs on the ground to help me out. I hired a strength and conditioning coach to get me in tip top shape. I have been working a lot on my stand up and also my submission defense.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Give me your thoughts on your Finals opponent, Vinicius Magalhaes.</p>


	<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> <em>Vinny is a beast on the ground. He is on a different level. I feel his weakness is his stand up and his heart. I feel that if I bring the fight to him he will eventually look for a way out. That being said, he is a very formidable opponent and I look forward to a great fight.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> You’ve probably talked to C.B. about how <span class="caps">TUF</span> changed his life.  What do you think winning <span class="caps">TUF</span> would do for you?  How do you think it will change your life?</p>


	<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> <em>Yeah, I have talked to C.B. and personally have seen what it has done for him. Winning <span class="caps">TUF</span> will skyrocket my career. It will put me on the <span class="caps">MMA</span> map.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Can you talk about Nogueira and what it meant to you to train with him?  Do you plan on training with him in the future?</p>


	<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> <em>When I was picked first by Nogueira I was extremely honored. He is everything that he is made out to be on the show and more. He really cared about his fighters and wasn’t just going through the motions, just trying to get his face out there. He was upset when our guys lost and genuinely ecstatic when we were successful. It was a great experience to train with him day in and day out. I learned a lot from him, not just technique but also work ethic, heart, etc. Just watching him train and stay after until everything was perfect. He made you want to step your game up and immolate him.</em></p>


	<p><em>He told us that the door was always open. A couple of us went out to his gym in Miami for a week last month.  He was in Brazil but we worked with his staff from the show.  I can’t say enough good things about Nogueira.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Other than “Big Nog,” are there any other fighters that you look up to?</p>


	<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> <em>Definitely, I respect all fighters, and just getting to work with Anderson Siva was amazing.  He is in a whole different class then everybody in terms of striking.  I watch and look up to him immensely. Dan Henderson is another fighter that I look up to because I feel we have a very similar fighting style. We both have the same background and come from the same training, so it is nice seeing him be so successful.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Speaking of trainers, do you have any good Stanky stories to share?</p>


	<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> <em>Oh yeah, Stanky is a character. I’ve got a ton. The best story was his involvement in an altercation at a casino. We were told about this by one of the assistant coaches.</em></p>


	<p><em>After practice one day all the coaches went to eat at the Palms and watch the Lakers vs. Celtics basketball game. Stanky is a diehard Lakers fan being that he is from LA. First off Stanky had on his <span class="caps">TUF</span> red rashguard still all sweaty from practice, his full TapouT velour tracksuit that is also red. He also had on a TapouT beanie, and about three to four big gold chains plus his earrings. They are watching the game at the Palms bar and some guy who is sitting at another table starts loudly cheering for the Celtics. This happens a couple more times, and Stanky who is hopped up on Tequila had had enough. He gets up, walks over to the guy and open hand slaps the guy across the face! He then yells, “Do you know who I’m with?  I’m with the heavyweight champion of the world and we’ll kick your ass!” Nogueira and the Brazilians grab Stanky and get out of there quickly.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> This season of <span class="caps">TUF</span> has also turned a lot of stomachs.  We have seen you and a bunch of guys eat urine-soaked fruit and saw another fighter take on some sushi with special sauce.  Was the house really this crazy?  Were there really that many pranks while at the house?  How did you keep sane through all of this?</p>


	<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> <em>Oh yeah, you saw it, those were not set up at all. You get extremely bored in the house and the pranks were just a way we could have fun with each other. I think the Sushi was a little too much but everything else wasn’t that bad. The urine fruit was tasteless, and in the end it was our own fault for stealing the fruit, so what could we do.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Now that you have had some exposure with The Ultimate fighter, how has life been different for you?  Are you people recognizing you in public?  More women?  Are more guys starting fights with you at the clubs/bar?</p>


	<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> <em>Yeah I do get recognized quite a bit when I’m out and about. I don’t do too bad with the girls, but definitely more are interested now, but you have to watch out for those ones. I haven’t had one instance where someone tried to fight me or basically say anything negative at all. I don’t walk around giving off an arrogant vibe and am usually very friendly so nothing like that has happened yet.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Right now you train with some real talented fighters like C.B. Dolloway, Thales Leites and Jamie Varner at Arizona Combat Sports.  What’s it like to train with so many elite fighters?  Are there any up-and-coming/young fighters at Arizona Combat Sports to keep our eyes on?</p>


	<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> <em>They are great, we have those guys plus guys like the Steinbiess brothers, Aaron Simpson, Forbes, Carlos Condit, plus many, many more. What makes our camp successful is that we are a very close knit group with no egos. When someone had a fight coming up we rally behind them and are there for them with whatever they need. Some guys in other camps train when they have a fight and are gone when they don’t. That is not the way we work. Those guys helped you out, and when its their turn you should be the first one in there for them.</em></p>


	<p><em>We have some great up and coming fighters at <span class="caps">ACS</span>. Aaron Simpson who just had a 16 second knockout in the <span class="caps">WEC</span> is going to be a stud. He is a three time All-American and was my coach at <span class="caps">ASU</span>. Jacob McKlintock is also a fighter that you will be seeing a lot more of.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> What do you see for yourself in the future?</p>


	<p><strong>Ryan:</strong> <em>To be the <span class="caps">UFC</span> champ, what would I be doing this for if I wanted to be mediocre? I train hard and put in the work day in and day out so that someday when I get the chance I can achieve my goals. I have always wanted to be the best at everything I do and this is no different.</em></p>


	<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Is there anybody you’d like to thank?</p>


	<p>I would like to thank the gym, Arizona Combat Sports with the Lally Brothers. <span class="caps">LG </span>Sports Marketing and Jason Genet. Also, <span class="caps">MTX  </span>Audio for always being there.</p>
